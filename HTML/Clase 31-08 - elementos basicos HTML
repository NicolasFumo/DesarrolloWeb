    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        The <i>HTTP 200 OK</i> success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. A 200 response is
        cacheable by default.

        The meaning of a success depends on the HTTP request method:

    <p>
        <b>GET:</b> The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>HEAD:</b> The representation headers are included in the response without any message body
    </p>

    <br>POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body
    <br>TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.
    The successful result of a PUT or a <br>DELETE is often not a 200 OK but a 204 No Content (or a 201 Created when the
    resource is uploaded for the first time).
